# DB Learning project

A basic setup for a PostgreSQL-based project with Docker, including essential configuration files and sample scripts.

## Getting Started

Clone repository:

```bash
git clone <git template url> <project_name>
```

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Run the project

To run the project using Docker, execute the following command

```bash
docker compose -f "docker-compose.yml" up -d --build
```

This command will:

Build the images as defined in docker-compose.yml
Start the containers in detached mode (-d)
Rebuild images if there are any changes in the source code (--build)

## Access the Swagger Documentation

After starting the project, you can view the API documentation generated by Swagger:

- Open [http://localhost:3000/swagger/](http://localhost:3000/swagger/) to access the full Swagger UI documentation.
- Alternatively, visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the main endpoint, which may include links or redirects to the documentation.

Ensure that the application is running on `localhost:3000` as specified in your Docker setup.

## Development Mode

To run the project in development mode, youâ€™ll need to start Docker first to initialize the database container, then stop the application container and start it locally.

1. **Start Docker**: Run the full Docker setup to initialize all containers (including the database):

   ```bash
   docker compose -f "docker-compose.yml" up -d --build
   ```

2. **Stop the App Container**: Stop only the application container, `db-1-app-1`, so that you can run it locally with live-reloading:
   ```bash
   docker stop db-1-app-1
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd <project_name>
   npm install
   ```
4. **Set up Environment Variables**: Ensure that the `.env` file is configured properly, based on the `.env.example` file provided.
5. **Start in Development Mode**: Run the project locally in development mode with live reload using:
   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```
